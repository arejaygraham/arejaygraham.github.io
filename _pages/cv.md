Education
======
* B.S. in Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago, 2018
* PhD in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford, 2022 (expected)

Research experience
======
* DPhil Student - University of Oxford - Department of Physics, Sept. 2018 - present
  * Supervised by Raymond Pierrehumbert
  * I have carried out research on a variety of topics, generally aimed at understanding the conditions that allow for a temperate surface climate to be maintained on Earth-like planets.
  * I have multiple ongoing projects involving silicate weathering and its action as a stabilizing feedback on planetary climate.
  * I am also working on a collaborative project to model the properties of atmospheres with multiple condensable components of arbitrary concentration under varying assumptions about the retention of condensate in the atmosphere.
  * I am running models to examine the impacts of surface CO2 condensation on planetary climate.
  * I am preparing a manuscript describing the reduced sensitivity of planets in the mid-to-outer reaches of the habitable zone to transient CO2 perturbations of sizes that have caused catastrophe multiple times in Earth history. 
  
* College Research Fellow - University of Chicago - Department of Geophysical Sciences, Sept. 2016 - 2018
  * Worked with Professors Dorian Abbot and Tiffany Shaw
  * We analyzed the circulation of the stratosphere during Snowball Earth scenarios and how it differs from the circulation under modern conditions by running the ECHAM6 global climate model with varying combinations of initial conditions
  * We derived a simple theoretical result that partially validates assumptions made in estimating the pCO2 during a Snowball event from geochemical proxies.
  * We derived an extension of the Statistical Transformed Eulerian Mean framework for analyzing atmospheric circulations.
  * Our simulations indicate that wave forcing on the stratosphere from the troposphere is considerably reduced in the Snowball state, the polar vortex is greatly strengthened, and the stratosphere is cold enough for the formation of a class of clouds that may have important impacts on the climate
