Education
======
* B.S. in Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago, 2018
* PhD in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford, 2022 (expected)

Research experience
======
* DPhil Student - University of Oxford - Department of Physics, Sept. 2018 - present
  * Supervised by Raymond Pierrehumbert
  * I have carried out research on a variety of topics, generally aimed at understanding the conditions that allow for a temperate surface climate to be maintained on Earth-like planets.
  * I have multiple ongoing projects involving silicate weathering and its action as a stabilizing feedback on planetary climate.
  * I am also working on a collaborative project to model the properties of atmospheres with multiple condensable components of arbitrary concentration under varying assumptions about the retention of condensate in the atmosphere.
  * I am running models to examine the impacts of surface CO2 condensation on planetary climate.
  * I am preparing a manuscript describing the reduced sensitivity of planets in the mid-to-outer reaches of the habitable zone to transient CO2 perturbations of sizes that have caused catastrophe multiple times in Earth history. 
  
* College Research Fellow - University of Chicago - Department of Geophysical Sciences, Sept. 2016 - 2018
  * Worked with Professors Dorian Abbot and Tiffany Shaw
  * We analyzed the circulation of the stratosphere during Snowball Earth scenarios and how it differs from the circulation under modern conditions by running the ECHAM6 global climate model with varying combinations of initial conditions
  * We derived a simple theoretical result that partially validates assumptions made in estimating the pCO2 during a Snowball event from geochemical proxies.
  * We derived an extension of the Statistical Transformed Eulerian Mean framework for analyzing atmospheric circulations.
  * Our simulations indicate that wave forcing on the stratosphere from the troposphere is considerably reduced in the Snowball state, the polar vortex is greatly strengthened, and the stratosphere is cold enough for the formation of a class of clouds that may have important impacts on the climate
* Student Research Technician - UChicago - Department of Geophysical Sciences, June 2016 - 2018
  * Worked with professor Fred Ciesla 
  * Modeled the thermal evolution of chondritic planetesimals in the early Solar System to understand how  various parameters affect the final porosity state of a body (with implications for the expected outcomes of impacts between bodies)
  * Wrote a realistic numerical model of planetesimal evolution through time that considers abundances of radioactive elements, porosity evolution, hot-pressing, and heat transport within the body

* Collaborative Research Project - UChicago - Dept. Of Geophysical Sciences,  June 2017 - Nov. 2017
  * Worked as part of Dorian Abbot’s research group Science Family 
  * We ran the intermediate complexity global climate model PLaSIM to investigate the effect of solar day length on the transition to and from a Snowball state
  * We discovered that the strength of hysteresis between Snowball and non-Snowball decreases as a planet’s rotation approaches a tidally locked state, at which point the hysteresis disappears. 
  * This result suggests that sudden transitions to global glaciation may be less frequent and less severe on tidally influenced planets, bolstering their habitability compared to rapid rotators.
