I lived most of my life in Colfax, Illinois hoping extraterrestrials would put a crop circle in the cornfield adjacent to my house. I got a B.S. in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago in 2018. Now I'm working on a DPhil in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. I want to understand the mechanisms that can stabilize and destabilize the climates of Earth-like planets.
