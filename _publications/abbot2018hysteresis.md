title: "Decrease in hysteresis of planetary climate for planets with long solar days"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/abbot2018hysteresis
excerpt: '"We find that the amount of hysteresis (the range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate) is
significantly reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and disappears for solar days of hundreds of
Earth days. These results suggest that tidally influenced planets orbiting M and K stars that are not synchronously
rotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball bifurcations than they would if they were
rapidly rotating. This implies that the amount of time it takes them to escape a snowball state via CO2 outgassing
would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling between the warm and snowball state if they have low
CO2 outgassing rates."'

In this paper, we use the general circulation model PlaSim to show that slowly rotating planets have a much narrower range of instellations over which they display the bistability between temperate and snowball states that characterizes the climates of more rapidly rotating planets like the Earth. This suggests that slowly rotating planets are less vulnerable to catastrophic runaway glaciation than rapid rotators, which may increase their climatic stability in the outer reaches of the habitable zone.
