excerpt: '"The “liquid water habitable zone” (HZ) concept is predicated on the ability of the silicate weathering feedback to
stabilize climate across a wide range of instellations. However, representations of silicate weathering used in
current estimates of the effective outer edge of the HZ accounts for neither the thermodynamic limit on the
concentration of weathering products in runoff set by clay precipitation nor the energetic limit on precipitation set
by planetary instellation. We find that when the thermodynamic limit is included in an idealized coupled climate/
weathering model, the steady-state planetary climate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming
sensitive to temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to pCO2 through an effect on
solute concentration mediated by pH. This increases sensitivity to land fraction, CO2 outgassing, and geological
factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a profound effect on the position of the
effective outer edge of the HZ. The interplay between runoff sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation
leads to novel warm states in the outer reaches of the HZ, owing to the decoupling of temperature and precipitation.
We discuss strategies for detecting the signature of the silicate weathering feedback through exoplanet observations
in light of insights derived from the revised picture of weathering."'
